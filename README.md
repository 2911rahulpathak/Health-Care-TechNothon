## Outline of Idea

**Imagine a country where the government has introduced its health policy for the treatment and cure of rare diseases.** 
**Our Project is a suggestion for Changes in the National Health Policy for Rare Diseases Of Government of India which was Approved on 31 March 2021.**
**We have created a web portal/page which displays:**
- The nominal information regarding the policy. 
- A form for the patients where they would provide their details like income, age, address, disease diagnosed, phone number, etc. 
- Another form will be for donations. The donors would provide their details and would donate an amount, payment methods include Cryptocurrency (under development).

## Solution Provided

1. Eases load on government to setup registration portal framework By providing a Centralized System.
2. Provides first step to access to government aided treatment
3. Payement Made Through Ethereum will be Stored on Decentralized System so Anyone can View it And Is Trustworthy.
